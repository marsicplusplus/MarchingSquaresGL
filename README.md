Marching Squares implementation in C++ using glfw and GLAD.

## TODO:

- [ ] Fix those loops! I'm definitely doing the loops wrong as I get a segmentation fault if the window size is not square;
- [ ] Interpolation between vertices instead of always taking the middle point for less aliased lines;
- [ ] Colors!
